# -Validate-Synthetic-And-Real-World-Data-Using-Clustering-Techniques


This project implements K-means and hierarchical clustering methods on synthetic and real-world datasets. The clustering methods achieved an average accuracy of 85% in external validation metrics.

## Key Achievements

- Implemented K-means and hierarchical clustering on synthetic and real-world datasets.
- Achieved an average accuracy of 85% in external validation metrics.
- Applied clustering to the World Indicator dataset, resulting in an average silhouette score of 0.75 on internal validation metrics.
- Generated 3+ scatter plots with colored data points based on cluster groups, revealing visually distinct groups with clear patterns.

## Results

- **Clustering Accuracy:** 85%
- **Silhouette Score (World Indicator Dataset):** 0.75

## Project Structure
